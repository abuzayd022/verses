    "Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings].",
"This is the Book (the Qur'an), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqun [the pious and righteous persons who fear Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].",
"Who believe in the Ghaib and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and spend out of what we have provided for them [i.e. give Zakat, spend on themselves, their parents, their children, their wives, etc., and also give charity to the poor and also in Allah's Cause - Jihad, etc.].",
"And who believe in (the Qur'an and the Sunnah) which has been sent down (revealed) to you (Muhammad Peace be upon him) and in [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.] which were sent down before you and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter. (Resurrection, recompense of their good and bad deeds, Paradise and Hell, etc.).",
"They are on (true) guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.",
"Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him) warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.",
"Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearings, (i.e. they are closed from accepting Allah's Guidance), and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be a great torment.",
"And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day' while in fact they believe not.",
"They (think to) deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!",
"In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.",
"And when it is said to them: 'Make not mischief on the earth,' they say: 'We are only peacemakers.'",
"Verily! They are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not.",
"And when it is said to them (hypocrites): 'Believe as the people (followers of Muhammad Peace be upon him, Al-Ansar and Al-Muhajirun) have believed,' they say: 'Shall we believe as the fools have believed?' Verily, they are the fools, but they know not.",
"And when they meet those who believe, they say: 'We believe,' but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils - polytheists, hypocrites, etc.), they say: 'Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking.'",
"Allah mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrong-doings to wander blindly.",
"These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce was profitless. And they were not guided.",
"Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see.",
"They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the Right Path).",
"Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers (i.e. Allah will gather them all together).",
"The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things.",
"O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V.2:2).",
"Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).",
"And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad Peace be upon him), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.",
"But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.",
"And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: 'This is what we were provided with before,' and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e. in the same form but different in taste) and they shall have therein Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives), (having no menses, stools, urine, etc.) and they will abide therein forever.",
"Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: 'What did Allah intend by this parable?' By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).",
"Those who break Allah's Covenant after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined (as regards Allah's Religion of Islamic Monotheism, and to practise its legal laws on the earth and also as regards keeping good relations with kith and kin), and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.",
"How can you disbelieve in Allah? Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return.",
"He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything.",
"And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: 'Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.' They said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while we glorify You with praises and thanks (Exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners) and sanctify You.' He (Allah) said: 'I know that which you do not know.'",
"And He taught Adam all the names (of everything), then He showed them to the angels and said, 'Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.'",
"They (angels) said: 'Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise.'",
"He said: 'O Adam! Inform them of their names,' and when he had informed them of their names, He said: 'Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?'",
"And (remember) when We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam.' And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).",
"And We said: 'O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimun (wrong-doers).'",
"Then the Shaitan (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: 'Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.'",
"Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful.",
"We said: 'Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.",
"But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.",

    "O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfill (your obligations to) My Covenant (with you) so that I fulfill (My Obligations to) your covenant (with Me), and fear none but Me.",
    "And believe in what I have sent down (this Qur'an), confirming that which is with you, [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and buy not with My Verses [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] a small price (i.e. getting a small gain by selling My Verses), and fear Me and Me Alone. (Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. I, Page 253).",
    "And mix not truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth [i.e. Muhammad Peace be upon him is Allah's Messenger and his qualities are written in your Scriptures, the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] while you know (the truth).",
    "And perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, and Irka' (i.e. bow down or submit yourselves with obedience to Allah) along with Ar-Raki'un.",
    "Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allah) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?",
    "And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi'un [i.e. the true believers in Allah - those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His Punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise, etc.) and in His Warnings (Hell, etc.)].",
    "(They are those) who are certain that they are going to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are going to return.",
    "O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the 'Alamin (mankind and jinns) (of your time period, in the past).",
    "And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped.",
    "And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and therein was a mighty trial from your Lord.",
    "And (remember) when We separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) people while you were looking (at them, when the sea-water covered them).",
    "And (remember) when We appointed for Musa (Moses) forty nights, and (in his absence) you took the calf (for worship), and you were Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).",
    "Then after that We forgave you so that you might be grateful.",
    "And (remember) when We gave Musa (Moses) the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)] and the criterion (of right and wrong) so that you may be guided aright.",
    "And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: 'O my people! Verily, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf. So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves (the innocent kill the wrongdoers among you), that will be better for you with your Lord.' Then He accepted your repentance. Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.",
    "And (remember) when you said: 'O Musa (Moses)! We shall never believe in you till we see Allah plainly.' But you were seized with a thunderbolt (lightning) while you were looking.",
    "Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.",
    "And We shaded you with clouds and sent down on you Al-Manna and the quails, (saying): 'Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you,' (but they rebelled). And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves.",
    "And (remember) when We said: 'Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat bountifully therein with pleasure and delight wherever you wish, and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with humility) and say: 'Forgive us,' and We shall forgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers.'",
    "But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allah's Obedience. (Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. I, Page 305).",
    "And (remember) when Musa (Moses) asked for water for his people, We said: 'Strike the stone with your stick.' Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each (group of) people knew its own place for water. 'Eat and drink of that which Allah has provided and do not act corruptly, making mischief on the earth.'",
    "And (remember) when you said, 'O Musa (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fum (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions.' He said, 'Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!' And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins).",
    "Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.",
    "And (O Children of Israel, remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): 'Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V.2:2).",
    "Then after that you turned away. Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah upon you, indeed you would have been among the losers.",
    "And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: 'Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.'",
    "So We made this punishment an example to their own and to succeeding generations and a lesson to those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V.2:2).",
    "And (remember) when Musa (Moses) said to his people: 'Verily, Allah commands you that you slaughter a cow.' They said, 'Do you make fun of us?' He said, 'I take Allah's Refuge from being among Al-Jahilun (the ignorants or the foolish).'",
    "They said, 'Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!' He said, 'He says, 'Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions', so do what you are commanded.'",
    "They said, 'Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its colour.' He said, 'He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in its colour, pleasing to the beholders.' '",
    "They said, 'Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. Verily to us all cows are alike, And surely, if Allah wills, we will be guided.'"
